GNBG - II : Numerical Benchmark Suite\
Abstract: This repository provides extensive detail on the newly generated Generalized Numerical Benchmark Generator for 2025 CEC & GECCO Competitions (GNBG-II), consisting of 24 well-defined box-constrained problem instances. The new benchmarks are designed in line with the 2024 variants, keeping the salient features intact, including ruggedness, conditioning, symmetry, variable interactions, modality, deceptiveness, and basin linearity. The current benchmark suite offers higher levels of difficulty with added problem characteristics for rigorous evaluation and comparative analysis. We aim to provide an extensive platform to access the suitability of an algorithm against challenging problems with pre-defined characteristics.
